# UX

## User Goals
<!-- DESCRIPTIONS OF END RESULTS THAT USERS WANT TO REACH -->

## User Stories
<!-- INTERACTIONS THAT THE USER EXPECTS TO GO THROUGH TO COMPLETE THEIR GOALS -->

* As a user, I want to......

## User Requirements and Expectations
### Requirements
<!-- WHAT THE USER REQUIRES FOR THE PRODUCT TO BE SUCCESSFUL -->

### Expectations
<!-- WHAT THE USER EXPECTS FROM THE PRODUCT -->

* I expect to.....


## Site owners Goals
<!-- OUTLINE OF STRUCTURE AND FEASIBILITY OF USER GOALS/ STORIES -->


## Strategy
### Strategy Outline
The items are graded in a 0 - 5 system in both importance and feasibility as per the grading system below.

&nbsp;

| | Score - 0 | Score - 3 | Score - 5 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Importance | Unwise use of time to address | Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these
| Feasibility | Unwise use of time to address| Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these

&nbsp;

The outcome is calculated by combining the scores from the *Importance* and *Feasibility* ratings. This then gives a final strategy rating of what items and where to focus on.

| | Score - 0 | Score - 5 | Score - 10 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Item Description | Not viable | Efforts should be made | Efforts MUST be made

&nbsp;

### Strategy Description
|Item Description | Importance Score | Feasibility Score | Outcome |
| --------------- | ----------| -----------| ----------|
| <!-- ADD ITEM -->| <!-- ADD IMPORTANCE SCORE --> | <!-- ADD FESIBILITY SCORE --> | <!-- TOTAL OF IMPORTANCE & FEASIBILITY --> |
